Einstein had made a good defense on not cleaning desks. But, since he had never used a modern PC, I would be on the "declutter" side when it comes to desktops. Keeping a good naming convention, IMHO, is a great place to start.

You won't see a Windows user trying to "arrange their files" -- some complains about it, but almost none actually put effort, and even if they do, all those useless files and folders created by Microsoft's and other shitty softwares will turn them down.

# Style 1

## Documents

## Downloads

As the name suggests, I dumps all the thing I downloaded here. Instead of renaming things in here, I prefer moving them to where they belong and follow the convention there. To make it easier, I would let different program download into seperate subdirectories.

## Music

## Pictures

## Projects

All the things I created goes here. For a project named "Foo Bar"

## Videos

# Style 2
